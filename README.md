### TODO:
- [X] Write a program that represents the environment. It will need to manage the status of the queues, adding or removing customers and responding to actions taken by the sales person.
- [X] Write a program for the learning agent. It learns to take certain actions based on the state of the environment using dynamic programming.
- [X] Make the command line arguments more modular (allow for varying number of queue probabilities)
- [ ] Think of ways to show the performance of the learning algorithm.
- [ ] Look for ways to minimize all of the repeated code blocks (write some subroutines)
- [ ] Maybe restructure a little bit if we need to/have time to
